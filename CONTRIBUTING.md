### How to Report Bugs

1. **IMPORTANT:** If possible, report the bug to Wizards of the Coast so they're aware and can fix it.
   - **Companion:** You may [post an idea](https://feedback.wizards.com/forums/929932-companion-feedback) to the Companion Feedback forum. 
   - **Gatherer:** Wizards of the Coast does not appear to be currently accepting any reports for Gatherer, unfortunately. Issues reported via its original form go straight to closed. You can still report the issue here (and please do); continue to step 2.
1. Submit a copy of the issue on this GitHub project describing the problem.
   - If it's a **Gatherer** issue, please provide links to Gatherer where someone can see the problem. Provide screenshots if needed.
   - If it's a **Companion** or **Hunterer** issue, please provide directions as to where the problem can be found. Provide screenshots if needed.
1. If you have a submission number, issue link, or other support message from step 1, add it to your post.
4. Close the issue when you notice that WotC has fixed the problem.
